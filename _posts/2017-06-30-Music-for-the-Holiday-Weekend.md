Over the last few days, I feel like my Apple Music library has grown with lots of treat new music. With it being a holiday weekend, a lot of people might be traveling and need some new music. Here are some feel good pop records or songs to for your 4th of July.

## [Superfruit - Future Friends - Part One](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/future-friends-part-one/id1249023050?uo=4&app=itunes&at=1l3vwJx&ct=blog)

Scott and Mitch from the acapella group Pentatonix have produced the pop record they were made for. So catchy. So fun. I canâ€™t pick a favorite song.

## [Colin Mukri - Girlfriend](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/girlfriend-single/id1252387982?uo=4&app=itunes&at=1l3vwJx&ct=blog)

My friend Colin Mukri has just released his debut single, and it is ðŸ”¥. Stick around for that key change at the end.

## [David Ryan Harris - Songs for Other People](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/songs-for-other-people/id1238214399?uo=4&app=itunes&at=1l3vwJx&ct=blog)

I became aware of David Ryan Harris from his time in John Mayerâ€™s touring band. Heâ€™s an incredible singer and songwriter. Check out the song Coldplay for catchy goodness with unique production.

## [Jimmytrick Sweetwood - Foster Creighton, Pt. 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/foster-creighton-pt-2-single/id1254333528?uo=4&app=itunes&at=1l3vwJx&ct=blog)

My friends James Sweeting and Patrick Lockwood made a record together under the name Jimmytrick Sweetwood. It tells the story of Foster Creighton who build a staircase to the moon. Itâ€™s just beautiful.

## [LANY - LANY](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/lany/id1209353900?uo=4&at=1l3vwJx&ct=blog&app=itunes)

More poppy goodness. Straight up.

I hope everyone has a happy and safe 4th of July!
