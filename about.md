This is the microblog of Craig McClellan. 

You may be asking 2 questions now. Who is Craig McClellan, and what is a microblog? I will attempt to answer both of these questions below.

## Who is Craig McClellan?

A student once described me as vanilla with a beard. That sums me up pretty well.

If you want to know more, I’m husband to [Laura](http://lauramcclellan.com). We have two [foster daughters who are 4 and 2](http://craigandlaura.net) as well as 2 cats and a dog. There are a lot of creatures in our house that we have (get) to keep alive.

We live in Nashville, TN. I will argue the greatest city in the world.

I’m a 2nd grade teacher in a Nashville public school, and no, I’m not a glutton for punishment. I feel like I was made to work with children, and have so much fun every day with my kids. I love helping them reach their potential and seeing them grow.

In a former career, I was a professional musician so you might see me post about music from time to time.

I’m obsessed with all things Apple, and I have a lot of thoughts about that. I share those thoughts (along with other longer form content) on my blog, [The Class Nerd](http://theclassnerd.com).

## What is a microblog?

Essentially, Twitter. Twitter is a microblog. Short form posts on the internet.

But I host my short content here and cross post it to Twitter using [Manton Reece’s Micro.blog platform](http://micro.blog) instead of just posting to Twitter. As Manton himself says:

> Today, most writing instead goes into a small number of popular social networking sites. These sites became popular because they made it so easy to connect with friends and start publishing, and because they provided a timeline user experience that made interacting with everything easy and fast.
> 
> But this simplicity comes at a cost: it’s impossible to move content between these platform silos, ads are everywhere, and if a company goes out of business, all the writing hosted there vanishes from the internet.

I would rather control my own content than leave it in the hands of Twitter or any other company for that matter. Plus, it gives me a landing place on the web for people to find me.
