Subscribing to most blogs is easy. You decide you want to follow, then add the RSS feed to your feed reader of choice. Done. 

But with microblog posts here mixed with longer content, you may not want me filling up your feeds constantly. That's why I'm giving you some choice of how you want to subscribe.

- If you like me a lot and want to subscribe to everything coming through here, [this is the feed for you]({{ /feed.xml/ | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
- If you're just interested in microblog posts, [subscribe here]({{ /feed.microblog.xml/ | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
- If you just want longer content (aka content longer than 280 characters), [this feed is for you]({{ /feed.fullposts.xml/ | prepend: site.baseurl }}). 

Enjoy!
