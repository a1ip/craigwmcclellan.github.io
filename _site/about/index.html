  <p>This is the microblog of Craig McClellan.</p>

<p>You may be asking 2 questions now. Who is Craig McClellan, and what is a microblog? I will attempt to answer both of these questions below.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-craig-mcclellan">Who is Craig McClellan?</h2>

<p>A student once described me as vanilla with a beard. That sums me up pretty well.</p>

<p>If you want to know more, I’m husband to <a href="http://lauramcclellan.com">Laura</a>. We have two <a href="http://craigandlaura.net">foster daughters who are 4 and 2</a> as well as 2 cats and a dog. There are a lot of creatures in our house that we have (get) to keep alive.</p>

<p>We live in Nashville, TN. I will argue the greatest city in the world.</p>

<p>I’m a 2nd grade teacher in a Nashville public school, and no, I’m not a glutton for punishment. I feel like I was made to work with children, and have so much fun every day with my kids. I love helping them reach their potential and seeing them grow.</p>

<p>In a former career, I was a professional musician so you might see me post about music from time to time.</p>

<p>I’m obsessed with all things Apple, and I have a lot of thoughts about that. I share those thoughts (along with other longer form content) on my blog, <a href="http://theclassnerd.com">The Class Nerd</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-microblog">What is a microblog?</h2>

<p>Essentially, Twitter. Twitter is a microblog. Short form posts on the internet.</p>

<p>But I host my short content here and cross post it to Twitter using <a href="http://micro.blog">Manton Reece’s Micro.blog platform</a> instead of just posting to Twitter. As Manton himself says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, most writing instead goes into a small number of popular social networking sites. These sites became popular because they made it so easy to connect with friends and start publishing, and because they provided a timeline user experience that made interacting with everything easy and fast.</p>

  <p>But this simplicity comes at a cost: it’s impossible to move content between these platform silos, ads are everywhere, and if a company goes out of business, all the writing hosted there vanishes from the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would rather control my own content than leave it in the hands of Twitter or any other company for that matter. Plus, it gives me a landing place on the web for people to find me.</p>
