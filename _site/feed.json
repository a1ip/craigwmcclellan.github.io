To stop negative societal trends that are ravaged by drug addiction, we need an ‚Äúall hands on deck‚Äù approach to help vulnerable children in our own backyards. ¬†</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree with Senator Lankford that <strong>all</strong> families impacted by foster care need support and I believe reunification is important. We have fostered multiple children who were reunified, and it was a beautiful thing.</p>\n\n<p>I also think foster children should have a right to permanency. At what point does sticking with a goal of reunification begin to hurt a child‚Äôs wellbeing? If a 2.5 year old has been with foster parents over 2 years, how much more harmful would reunification be to the child than staying with the only family they know?</p>\n\n<p>The foster care system is broken in so many ways, and it‚Äôs always the kids who are the victims.</p>\n",

			"title": "Thoughts on New iPad Hardware at WWDC",
			
			"content_html": "<p>Apple blogs and podcasts are all predicting new iPad Pros released next week at WWDC. While I would love for this to happen and will be first in line to get an iPhone X style iPad, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to get them for 2 reasons.</p>\n\n<p>First, there‚Äôs the lack of leaks. While this is not a perfect indicator due to Apple‚Äôs increased focus on privacy, I still find it hard to believe they‚Äôve come so far since the massive leaks surrounding iPhone X last fall. I feel like we would have seen supply chain leaks of form factors for new iPads with no bezels if they are coming. This suggests either the new iPad Pros will just be a speed bump to include the A11X processor with no form factor change or new form factors won‚Äôt be released until the fall.</p>\n\n<p>The other factor which makes me think not until the fall is Face ID. Currently on iPhone X, Face ID only works in portrait mode. For an iPad which is rotated far more than an iPhone, facial recognition in both orientations is a necessity. This seems to me like a feature that would come to iOS in a major .0 update rather than say iOS 11.5. I also don‚Äôt think they would release iPads with this feature and not add it to iPhone X. So my thought is multi-orientation Face ID will be announced as part of iOS 12 next week. Then in September when new iPhones are announced, new iPad Pros will also be announced that take advantage of this feature.</p>\n\n<p>This is just a guess, and I really hope to be proven wrong. However I wanted to put it out into the world just for the bragging rights just in case.</p>\n",
