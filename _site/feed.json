			"content_html": "<p>I have officially started the process of moving my blog, The Class Nerd, from Squarespace to Micro.blog. I have struggled with squarespace for a long time as an iOS only user, and as Micro.blog has matured as a platform, it has become more and more powerful. That, combined with the ability for me to post content directly to Micro.blog from Drafts 5, has let me to moving.</p>\n\n<p>I currently have <a href=\"https://micro.blog/theclassnerd\">@theclassnerd</a> set up here on Micro.blog, and I have just moved the domain over.</p>\n\n<p>If you are subscribed to The Class Nerd via RSS, you‚Äôll need to use the new feed (or JSON feed). If you follow me on Micro.blog and want to continue to see my posts about education technology, you should follow <a href=\"https://micro.blog/theclassnerd\">@theclassnerd</a>. All posts via The Class Nerd will also go to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/theclassnerd\">The Class Nerd twitter account</a>.</p>\n\n<p>CraigMcClellan.com will continue as my personal blog covering everything from Apple to foster care to Star Wars. All posts about how I get my work done as a teacher using iOS will be on The Class Nerd. Follow along even if you‚Äôre not a teacher though. Hopefully it‚Äôs still useful.</p>\n\n<p>I have a lot of stuff planned for The Class Nerd in the next few weeks, and having it hosted here on Micro.blog enables a lot of that. I‚Äôm excited for what the future holds.</p>\n",

To stop negative societal trends that are ravaged by drug addiction, we need an ‚Äúall hands on deck‚Äù approach to help vulnerable children in our own backyards. ¬†</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree with Senator Lankford that <strong>all</strong> families impacted by foster care need support and I believe reunification is important. We have fostered multiple children who were reunified, and it was a beautiful thing.</p>\n\n<p>I also think foster children should have a right to permanency. At what point does sticking with a goal of reunification begin to hurt a child‚Äôs wellbeing? If a 2.5 year old has been with foster parents over 2 years, how much more harmful would reunification be to the child than staying with the only family they know?</p>\n\n<p>The foster care system is broken in so many ways, and it‚Äôs always the kids who are the victims.</p>\n",
