  <p>Today we celebrate what my wife is calling our 2nd annual “Family Day.” On this day, 2 years ago, these girls were brought to us to foster. As we did last year, we went and got donuts.</p>

<p>As seems to be the case with many big days, somehow they end up being harder. There’s been a lot of crying and arguments between the girls today, but we wouldn’t trade it.</p>

<p>Today isn’t even significant to them. They’re so young and have been with us so long they don’t know any different. It is to us though.</p>

<p>I’m praying that this is the last Family Day where we don’t know what the future will hold for our status as a family. The last one where I can’t share their beautiful faces with you. The last one where we don’t share a last name.</p>

<p>I’m thankful for 2 years being Daddy to these amazing girls. Here’s to many many more.</p>
