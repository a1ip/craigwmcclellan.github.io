  <p>This post <strong>contains spoilers</strong> for The Last Jedi.</p>

<p>Jacob Hall, <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/the-last-jedi-defense/2/">writing for SlashFilm</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s telling that <em>The Force Awakens</em> feels like a cinematic adaptation of our nostalgic <em>feelings about  Star Wars</em> instead of a <em>Star Wars</em> movie as conceived by George Lucas.</p>

  <p>Perhaps that’s why <em>The Last Jedi</em> is such a jarring experience, one that feels specifically built to make audiences work through their feelings about this universe. Rian Johnson is unabashedly political and unafraid to slaughter the sacred cows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the first hour or so of the movie last night, I kept thinking <em>The Last Jedi </em> didn’t feel like a Star Wars movie the way <em>The Force Awakens</em> did, but I couldn’t put my finger on why. But slowly, as the movie went on, I got more and more excited about what I was seeing.</p>

<p>I think this quote (and really the whole article) from Jacob Hall does a great job of summarizing how I felt. I went in expecting the second part of The Force Awakens and getting something entirely different…and that’s actually great.</p>

<p>A few other quick thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All along I wanted Rey’s parents to be nobody. I didn’t get many of my hopes or predictions, but this was one I was really pleased with.</li>
  <li>I’m also glad I didn’t go with huge theories as to who Snoke was. I wanted to know more about him, but I wasn’t obsessed. That turned out to be for the best. That whole scene and the lightsaber fight after were incredible.</li>
  <li>I’m still not sure how I feel about Luke trying to kill Ben. I think it served the story discussing the Jedi hubris well though.</li>
  <li>The main thing I didn’t really care about was Canto Bight. I could have done without that whole sequence. I liked Rose, and I liked her having a side adventure with Finn, but what they did didn’t do it for me.</li>
  <li>On first watch, the premise with the Resistance fleet flying just out of range of the First Order felt like a Doctor Who plot line that you shouldn’t think about too hard. Not that that‘s terrible. I love Doctor Who. It just seemed like a thread you probably shouldn’t pull at.</li>
  <li>I loved the interactions with Luke and Rey as well as Rey and Kylo Ren. I thought Luke having a crazy old man vibe was fun.</li>
  <li>It’s strange that all 3 principal characters from the original trilogy are gone. With Carrie Fisher’s tragic death, I hope we get force ghost Luke in Episode IX. Not having any of them would be sad.</li>
  <li>I can’t wait to see this movie again. I loved it.</li>
</ul>
